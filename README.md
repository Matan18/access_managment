# AccessManagment

This project is a study about phoenix & elixir, I'm trying to create a access managment where a user can define it's subordinates permissions based on your own.

# Init

To start your Phoenix server:

- Be sure to have installed [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) in version 1.14.5 and [erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) in version 24 and postgres runing
- Be sure to have installed and runnig [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) somehow and confirm access settins on [dev.exs](./config/dev.exs)
- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
